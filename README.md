# winsudo
`winsudo` is an otherwise dumb implementation of the linux command `sudo` in windows, built using C#. It's really stupid so please just think of it as a joke and not as an actual project.

### Limitations
Due to limitations in Microsoft Windows, A UAC prompt will be required to start your `winsudo`'d application or argument. While you can get rid of this by turning off UAC, please don't unless you really know what you're doing.

### Features
Password Entry (work in progress)  
The general feeling of the `sudo` command at your Windows CLI.

### Compiling
I have no idea how to write compiling instructions. Just compile it like any C program.
